Developed a project for transliterating Tamil Brahmi scripts to modern Tamil using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
Input images of the script were split into individual character images, which were then processed by the CNN model to predict the modern Tamil text. 
A Streamlit interface was created to provide interactive experience.
